After having rushed the whole thing we just hit a wall. Therefore we started all over again focusing on comprehending the card's logic and the basics. This experience teached us to take our time to build a home on healthy foundations.

### Basics
```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Ui
-To be able to use the user interface you need to be on Linux Xubuntu.

Make sure to plug in your MicroBit card.

Then, you need the Thonny code editor.

Go to options -> configure -> select interpreter -> choose BBC Microbit.

Copy or open the ThonnyCom.py file and start the program.

Once the MicroBit is no longer flashing you can close Thonny.

Then open a terminal and run the communication.py file with this command : python3 communication.py.

You may need to be in teh same folder in order for it to work.

Then at any moment in the game press B A B B A to show the Ui.
